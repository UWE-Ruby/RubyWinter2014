Pirates love to sing @@@Adjective @@@NounPlural called limericks. Here are two favorites, usually on the tip of every pirate's @@@BodyPart:

A pretty, @@@Adjective pirate named Alice 
Broke into the king's @@@Adjective palace.
She caused a/an @@@Adjective scene,
But she soon became queen--
That pretty, @@@Adjective pirate of malice.

There once was a/an @@@Noun named Billy.
His @@@Noun mates considered him quite silly.
He's @@@Verb up the mast
While shouting, "Avast!"
As the ship @@@VerbPassTense up to Philly.
