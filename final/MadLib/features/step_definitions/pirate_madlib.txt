Pirates love to sing blue dogs called limericks. Here are two favorites, usually on the tip of every pirate's nose:

A pretty, hard pirate named Alice 
Broke into the king's loud palace.
She caused a/an tall scene,
But she soon became queen--
That pretty, round pirate of malice.

There once was a/an calendar named Billy.
His planet-mates considered him quite silly.
He's laugh up the mast
While shouting, "Avast!"
As the ship running up to Philly.
