Using a/an @@@Noun tied to his tail, Sylvester pulled himself up to Tweety's birdcage and @@@VerbPastTense inside. Sylvester @@@Adverb opened the cage as Tweeted started to shout, "@@@SillyWord!" Not wanting to be caught by Granny, Sylvester @@@Adverb hid Tweety inside a glass jar, holding it shut with his @@@Noun. The jar was soundproof and, although Tweety was @@@Verb up and down and @@@Verb a drum, he couldn't be heard. Then Tweety pulled out a pin, smiling at Sylvester who had begin to sweat, and poked him in his nose so he could escape. Sylvester @@@Adverb released Tweety, who started yelling again. Afraid of Granny, Sylvester hurried back to the floor and pretended to be alseep. Granny heard Tweety and came into the room with a/an @@@Noun and started hitting Sylvester over the head with it. Then she tossed Sylvester out in the snow. All he could do was complain @@@Adverb to himself, "Sufferin' Succotash!"
