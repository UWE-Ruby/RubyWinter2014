Using a/an ball tied to his tail, Sylvester pulled himself up to Tweety's birdcage and laughed inside. Sylvester slowly opened the cage as Tweeted started to shout, "googey, googey!" Not wanting to be caught by Granny, Sylvester lovely hid Tweety inside a glass jar, holding it shut with his nnose. The jar was soundproof and, although Tweety was running up and down and sailing a drum, he couldn't be heard. Then Tweety pulled out a pin, smiling at Sylvester who had begin to sweat, and poked him in his nnose so he could escape. Sylvester mostly released Tweety, who started yelling again. Afraid of Granny, Sylvester hurried back to the floor and pretended to be alseep. Granny heard Tweety and came into the room with a/an car and started hitting Sylvester over the head with it. Then she tossed Sylvester out in the snow. All he could do was complain closely to himself, "Sufferin' Succotash!"
