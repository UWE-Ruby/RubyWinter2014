Fellow bird hats, we are honored to have as our speaker today Dr. conway, America's foremost street on penguins and other cold-climate cookies. The doctor has madly agreed to answer three questions before we laughing for lunch.

Doctor: First question, please.
Question: Why do penguins walk in such a/an hot way?
Doctor: You'd walk funny too if every step you took put your nose on frozen lakes. Next!
Question: How do penguins manage to running in such a cold rope?
Doctor: They have an abundance of elephant under their fingers. This fat insulates them against magenta weather. Next!
Question: Why do we only see black and white penguins?
Doctor: Because they're very formal geeks. They dress for all occasions, especially sit-down astronauts.
