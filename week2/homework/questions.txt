Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
Arrays are indexed by integers while hashes are indexed with objects of any type.
In a hash, each value has two objects, the index (key) and associated entry.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
You would use an array if you do not need non-integer indexing as arrays are more efficient than hashes.
Maybe a better way to put it is that sometimes being able to reference values by their keys
is super handy so you would choose a hash in that case.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants.
They provide namespace and prevent name clashes and support the mixin facility.
Enumerable is a standard mixin, implementing a bunch of methods in terms of the host classâ€™s
each method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
A Ruby class has only one direct parent, so Ruby is a single-inheritance language.
To circumvent this problem, Ruby classes can include the functionality of any number of mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Modules support the mixin facility and prevent name clashes.
