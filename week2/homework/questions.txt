Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is indexed with integers only, while a hash can be indexed
with objects of any type.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
A typical use of the hash, according to the book The Well-Grounded Rubyist,
is storing strings along with their abbreviations. For example, state names and their
abbreviations.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are a way of bundling methods, classes and constants together.
Enumerable is a standard mixin. When Enumerable is mixed into a class, the class
has to define an each instance method. Objects of that class are then able to
to call any instance method defined in the Enumerable module.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
With Ruby being a single-inheritance language, a Ruby class has just one direct parent.
However, classes can include the functionality of any number of mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Classes have instances while modules do not.
