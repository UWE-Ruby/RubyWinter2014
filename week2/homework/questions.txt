1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is an ordered list of items (objects in ruby), indexed by sequential
integers starting at 0. 
A hash is a set of key=value pairs, indexed by the key. Traditionally it is not
ordered, but the pickaxe book says ruby retains the order items are stored. 
Other languages would view this as too costly. Is ruby slower by this?

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
I would use an array when 
  order is the best way access or enter the values, or
  the data structure has a known number of items
A hash is nice when
  a name is the best way to access or enter the values

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
