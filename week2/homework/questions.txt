Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?

Hash is indexed on objects where as Array is indexed on integers. 

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?

I would use an Array to maintain a collection of similar objects, where as a Hash for dissimilar ones.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?

Module defines a namespace, grouping together methods, constants and classes, which can
be mixed-in into other classes.

Enumerable is mixin that provides sorting, searching and traversal functionality.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?

A class can have only one parent. But we can inherit the behavior of more than one thing by using mixins. 

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?

Module can't be instantiated like a Class. Multiple module can be included in a class, where as only
one class can be inherited by other.
