Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
A hash stores a whole integer while an array can hold any object. 

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
You would use a hash when you have a key and an object corresponding to that key, such as the key being "name" and the object being the person's name. 

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is simliar to a library, and it interacts with functions to perform repeatable processes. Enumerable allows you to terminate a loop cleanly when there are no additional values. 

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
You cannot inherit more than one thing in Ruby, and you get around this with mixins. 

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
Modules interact with functions while classes are about objects.
