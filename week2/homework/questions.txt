Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
	An array is an interger indexed collection of objects. A hash is a collection of key-value pairs that are ordered by the way that they were inserted.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
	You would use an array for things that would just need to be in an indexed list and a hash for things that each have some sort of relation to something else.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
	A module has methods and constants that can be included in a class. The Enumerable moduleprovides a lot of options you can do with a list of objects (each, sort, min, max...)

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
	No but you can include mixins to get around that problem.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
	A Class is inevitably inherited from another class and modules can't be inherited.
