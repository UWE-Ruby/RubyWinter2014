Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
An array is an ordered list of items that are referenced by their index (order), a hash is a collection of items that can be referenced by a key and have no order.

Hash is indexed on objects where as Array is indexed on integers. 

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
When the items have an inherent order I would use an array, when I want to reference the items in my collection by a name or key and their order does not matter I would use a hash.

I would use an Array to maintain a collection of similar objects, where as a Hash for dissimilar ones.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
A module is a way to group code that you can use across multiple classes. Enumerable is a Ruby module that provides collection functionality; iteration, searching, and sorting. It requires an implementation of the each method.

Module defines a namespace, grouping together methods, constants and classes, which can
be mixed-in into other classes.

Enumerable is mixin that provides sorting, searching and traversal functionality.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No, multiple inheritance is not allowed in Ruby. You can include multiple modules if you wanted to mix-in different functionality into your code. Code that is related with a hierarchical nature should be subclassed (inherited). A class can only have 1 direct parent, but can have lots of ancestors.

A class can have only one parent. But we can inherit the behavior of more than one thing by using mixins. 

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
<<<<<<< HEAD

Module can't be instantiated like a Class. Multiple module can be included in a class, where as only
one class can be inherited by other.
=======
A class can be instantiated into an object, a module cannot. A module is code that can be used across many classes.
