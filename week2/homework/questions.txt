Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
Both are a collection of object references. Arrays are accessed using an integer index. Hashes are accessed using an unique key, which can be of any type. Hashes also have key|value pairs.

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
Arrays should be used when access with an integer index is sufficient. Otherwise, hashes should be used.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
Modules are containers of methods, classes and/or constants. They can be included in classes. Enumerable is a mixin that provides sorting of a collection in classes that contain an 'each' method.

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
No. By using mixins.

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
A module cannot be instantiated, does not support inheritance (but has mixins), and can be included in classes. A class can be instantiated, supports limited inheritiance and cannot be included in other classes.
