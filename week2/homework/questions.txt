Sharing Functionality: Inheritance, Modules, and Mixins

1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
A hash uses a key value pair, which is benifitial if you need to do lookups on
either. usually used when you have a one to one relationship, ex.
FirstName=Joe
LastName=Smith

With an array, its is just a listing where each element in the array is
associated by an numerical index. This is useful if you have a listing of the
same times of items, ex.
Kids=sally,bobby,fred

2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
I use a hash when i would need to lookup a value based on its key, or vice
versa.

3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?
a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants
an enumerable is a standard mixin, which combines a bunch of methods, i like
the map enumerable which makes running blocks of code much cleaner

4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?
use mixins

5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class?
ruby-doc.org says it best
Every class is also a module, but unlike modules a class may not be mixed-in
to another module (or class). Like a module, a class can be used as a
namespace. A class also inherits methods and constants from its superclass.
However, you can put a mix-in a module but not a class
