1. What is the difference between a Hash and an Array?
A hashes are more flexible as you can index them using symbols, strings and regular expressions as opposed to just integers.



2. When would you use an Array over a Hash and vice versa?
   I would use a hash if i needed to store the list using a key word or string for each variable.  An array is simpler to set up and 
simply uses an integer as it's key value pair based on the order that the variables are in the array.  Arrays are easier to manipulate using integers.



3. What is a module? Enumerable is a built in Ruby module, what is it?  A module is a collection of methods, constants and classes.  
Ennumberable is a built in mixin which provides various capabilities of sorting data.



4. Can you inherit more than one thing in Ruby? How could you get around this problem?  Ruby is a single inheritance language.  
Mixins can be used within ruby  classes to get around this limitation.



5. What is the difference between a Module and a Class? A module can't have instances.  A module is a chunk of reusable 
code in it's own ruby program that i can call from another program using "requires".  Modules can contain functions and/or variables.  
Classes are like modules with the exception that you can use them to create new instances of each other without them interfering with each other.
