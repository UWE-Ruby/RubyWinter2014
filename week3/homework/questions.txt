1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is a lot like a string in that it stores a chuck of data which can 
be used multiple times through your program.


2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
A string and symbol both store data.  The difference is that while the data
in a string can change, the data in a symbol will always stay the same unless
it is overwritten.  This is referred to as being immutable.  However, a string
can be frozen giving it the characteristics of a symbol.  The advantage to using 
a symbol over a frozen string is in the way that the symbol is stored in memory
allowing for better program performance by using strings.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?  Blocks are chunks of code that 
are loaded while the ruby source is being executed or after the ruby code has 
executed.  The BEGIN blocks are exectued while the code is getting loaded and is
started wiht the BEGIN delclaration.  The END blocks are executed after the program
has run and is started with the END declaration.  There can be multiple BEGIN
and END blocks in a program. 

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature? A block is
passed to a method by surrounding the block with curly braces after calling the
method.

5. Where would you use regular expressions? Regular expressions are used for
pattern matching.    There are many expression patterns associated with expressions
which gives a wide variety of matching and manipulating data.
