1. What is a symbol?

<<<<<<< HEAD
A symbol in Ruby is an identifier corresponding to a name, but can be any string of characters. 

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

The object id for a symbol will always be the same, but a string's object id will return different objects. 

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

A block is a chunk of code that can be run as the file is loaded. You must call out these blocks with a Begin block and an End block. 

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

You define your variable, and where you want to place your block, yield and then the block name to call that block of code into that section. 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?

You would use a regular expression if you needed to search strings for a specific pattern of symbols, and then manipulate that pattern.
