1. What is a symbol?
A symbol is an identifier corresponding to a string of characters, often a name.
They cannot be changed, only overwritten.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?
Symbols are immutable (cannot be changed, same object id) while strings are not.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?
A block is a chunk of code enclosed between either braces or the keywords do
and end. Blocks can take parameters and are called by a method (like they are 
another parameter passed to a method).

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?
You just put the code after the invocation of the method. I think a method signature 
is the name of the method and the paramaters that are required.

5. Where would you use regular expressions?
Any time you need to match a pattern in a string. Like say you were trying to 
see if the word "kitten" is in a line of text or if a line starts with "Once", etc.
