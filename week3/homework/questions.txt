1. What is a symbol?

Symbol is a constant, that uniquely identifies string of characters (named thing). It is respresented as a colon followed by a string of characters.

2. What is the difference between a symbol and a string?

Since symbol is a constant its value/content can't be changed, where as a string content can be changed. Also a symbol is created only once irrespective of how many times we use it, where as a string is created multiple times if used at multiple places.

3. What is a block and how do I call a block?

Block is one or more lines of code enclosed in braces or keywords do and end. Block passed to a method can be invoked by using "yield" statement inside method definition.

4. How do I pass a block to a method? What is the method signature?

A block is passed to a method, by defining it immediately after the method invocation. If there are parameters to the method, then block should be defined after the parameters are specified.

def method1
...
end

method1 { "block that would be passed to method 1" } 

def method2 (para1, para2)
...
end

method2 (a, b) do 
	"block that would" \
		"be passed to method2"
end 

5. Where would you use regular expressions?

Regular expression is a string of characters that defines a pattern. The patterns are used:

 a. To test if a string or part of a string matches the pattern
 b. To extract information from a string that matches the given pattern
 c. To change (.i.e substitue/delete) sections within a string that matches the pattern
