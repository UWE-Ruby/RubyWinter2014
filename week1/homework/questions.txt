Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
Everything you manipulate is an object, and the results of those manipulations are themselves objects.

2. What is a variable?
A reference to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
A class is a way to define methods for objects and is an object itself.

4. What is a String?
Strings are objects holding sequences of characters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
length, split, upcase

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
single quotes = fewer escape sequences, usually used when you don't need something in the quotes to change (no interpolation).
double quotes = lots of escape sequences and interpolation, ie. "#{some_var} is awesome!" to add some_var to string.
