A sequence of characters.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

split, which will divide the string at a specific character 
encoding, which will tell you which method of encoding is used by the string and it’s source file 
chomp, which will remove extra spaces around the characters

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? 

“…” can be used to define a string

%q/… / can be used to define a string

The escape sequences supported within each of them, as well as which character you’d need to use an escape sequence before in order for it to print in the string.
