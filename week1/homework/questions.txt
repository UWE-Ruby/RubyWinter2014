1. What is an object?

Everything we manipulate in ruby is an object. 

2. What is a variable?

Variables hold an objects state. It's a reference to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Every object in Ruby was generated either directly or indirectly from a class.

4. What is a String?

Sequences of charachters and objects of the class "Strings".

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

The string class is one of the largest classes. Three methods in the string class are "chomp" to remove the last chrachter, "length", to return the length of a string, and "capitalize" to return the string with the first charachter in uppercase. 

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

Single quotes or double quotes:
my_string = "string1"
my_string = 'string2'
Double quotes are usefull for string interpolation, for example:
my_dir = "#{base_dir}/shared/bin"
Double quoted strings can also handle more escape sequences.
