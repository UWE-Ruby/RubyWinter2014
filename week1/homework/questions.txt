Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?
Object is an instance of a class having:
a. Unique internal state
b. Attributes that expose internal state to external world
c. Methods using which one can interact with Object and read/change the internal state.

2. What is a variable?
variable is a placeholder/identifier of data.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
class defines an object/class of objects.
When I create an object, I create an instance of a class that defines the object.

4. What is a String?

String is a sequence of characters represented as a single entity. 

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

a. String.eql?(another_string) : Tests the equality of two strings.
b. String.clear : Empties the string
c. String.length : Returns the length of the string

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

A String literal can be defined in the following ways:

a. Using single-quote .i.e singleQuotedStr = 'This is a single quoted string'. This can also be done like singleQuotedStr = %q{This is a single quoted string}
b. Using double-quote .i.e doubleQuotedStr = "This is a double quoted string". This can also be done like doubleQuotedStr = %Q{This is a double quoted string}

Double-quoted string allows variables to be inserted into it and interpretd at run time. This is not possible with single-quoted strings.
