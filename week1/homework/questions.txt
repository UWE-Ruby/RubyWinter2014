1. What is an object?
<<<<<<< HEAD
	Anything that is manipulated in Ruby can be considered an object.

2. What is a variable?
	A variable is a name that is assigned to a value.  This value can be a single word/character, number or string of characters.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
  A class and an object are essentially the same thing except in maybe scope.  A object has all the attributes of the class but might have some additional.  An object Dog may belong to class Mammal.  A dog has all the attributes of the class, but also has some additional attributes.

4. What is a String?
  A string is an object that holds characters and can later be manipulated.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
  Three methods that can ben sent to a string object are: split, chomp and squeeze!.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
  Two ways of defining a String literal are single quotes ('') and double quotes ("").  The later allows the use of more escape characters.
=======
An object is a representation in memory of a specific concept or thing that the Ruby interpreter knows about. 

2. What is a variable?
A variable is a name for a location in memory. It can contain, or point to, any type of object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
An object is an instance of a class, or a specific thing of that class's type in memory. The class is the specifics that are common to all things of that type. The classification of a concept or a thing is a class. A specific thing or concept of a class's type in memory is an object. For example: All books have titles (Class). This book's title is "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" (Object). 

4. What is a String?
A string is how Ruby understands text. It is a collection of characters (Bytes), and can be created by making an instance of the String class (String.new) or as a string literal ("",'', %Q[]).

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
chomp! - removes newline characters, or the specified characters, from the end of a string
strip! - removes leading or trailing whitespace from a string
split  - returns an array of strings made up of the original string separated on whitespace or the specified characters or regexp

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between the two?
Single quotes ex: '' and Double quotes ex: "". The single quotes allow for 2 escape characters: \' and \\ . The double quoted string literal allows for many different escaped special characters (like \n is a line break) and allows for string interpolation, or the injection of evaluated Ruby code into the string ex: "Hello #{my_name}". The single quoted string takes up much less memory than a double quoted string with interpolation. Without interpolation, both are about the same.
