Chapter 3 Classes, Objects, and Variables 
p.86-90 Strings (Strings section in Chapter 6 Standard Types)

1. What is an object?

An object is an instance of a class that is represented in memory.

2. What is a variable?

Variables holds a reference to an object or data. There are different types of variables with different scopes. 

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

A class is the code or container that has properties ( methods / variable ) that can be used to create an instance of an object. A object is an instance of that class. 

4. What is a String?

A string are a sequence of characters, for example "Testing", "This is a string.", and even "324234". 

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

str.capitalize 
	This will capitalize a string

str.downcase
	returns a copy of the string where every uppercase character in the string is a lowercase 

str.hash
	returns a hash of the string

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

Good lord, I've never seen so many ways to define a string literal in a language before. What is the best practice here?

I'll the ones I find most interesting:

%q and %Q can be used to create string literals, and the difference between them is the degree of substitution performed. 

%q is the equivalent to a single-quoted delimited string, and a substitution is performed by using a single "\".

%q!This is a test string string!

%Q is the equivalent to a double-quote delimited string, and quoting the book supports a "boatload" more escape sequences. They reference the most common one, the new line sequence "\n"

%Q!Yada yada double quoted string!
