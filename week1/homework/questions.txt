1. What is an object?
Every object in Ruby is an instance of a particular class, which is itself an object.

2. What is a variable?
A variable refers to an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?
As explained by David Black in his book "The Well-Grounded Rubyist", classes define clusters of 
behavior or functionality and each object is an instance of a class. Objects can acquire 
methods and behaviors not defined in their class.

4. What is a String?
A string is a sequence of characters. Typically, a string holds printable characters.
It can also hold binary data.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods
length - returns the number of characters in a string
capitalize - returns a copy of the string in which the first character appears in uppercase and the rest in lowercase
reverse - returns a new string in which the characters appear in reverse order

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?
Double quotes and single quotes. The difference is you cannot do string interpolation in 
single-quoted strings. Also, more escape sequences are supported by double-quoted strings.
