1. What is an object?

# An opject is a "thing" that needs to be represented in code.  It is a particular instance of a Class, it contains state and it exhibits behavior.

2. What is a variable?

# A variable is a string of charactgers that is a reference to an object, but is not an object.

3. What is the difference between an object and a class?

#  An object is a particular instance of a class.  A class is a collection of related objects.

4. What is a String?

#  A string is a sequence of characters -- both printable and not -- that is an instance of the String class.

5. What are three messages that I can send to a string object? Hint: think methods

#  Change to lowercase (".downcase"),  remove the last character (".chop"), or split upon a defined character (".split").  In all cases, return the resulting object.

6. What are two ways of defining a String literal? Bonus: What is the difference between them?

#  You can use an set of defined delimiters such as quotes or %Q, or you can use a "here document".  A here document can be multiline.
