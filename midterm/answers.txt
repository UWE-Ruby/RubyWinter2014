 - What are the three uses of the curly brackets {} in Ruby?
1. For string interpolation, ex
  irb(main):001:0> name="fred"
  => "fred"
  irb(main):002:0> puts "Hello #{name}"
  Hello fred
  => nil
  irb(main):003:0>

2. They are the literal constructor for constructing a hash, ex.
   irb(main):003:0> hash={"ford" => "mustang","dodge" => "charger"}
   => {"ford"=>"mustang", "dodge"=>"charger"}
   irb(main):004:0> puts hash
   {"ford"=>"mustang", "dodge"=>"charger"}
   => nil
   irb(main):005:0>

3. You can put a code block in curly braces to deliminate instead of using do/end
  irb(main):006:0> array = [1,10,100]
  => [1, 10, 100]
  irb(main):008:0> puts array.map{|n|n+1}
  2
  11
  101
  => nil
  irb(main):009:0> 

 - What is a regular expression and what is a common use for them?
 Regular Expressions can be used in Ruby to do pattern matching, substitution, pretty much any type of string manipulation.

 - What is the difference between how a String, a symbol, a FixNum, and a Float are stored in Ruby?
   A symbol is a string that is stored as unique identifiers in memeory,meaning it is only stored once.
   A string on the other hand can be changed so it is stored many times, making look ups take longer
   A FixNum is stored as the value itself, in ruby 2.0 a float behaves like a FixNum

 - Are these two statements equivalent? Why or Why Not?
   1. x, y = "hello", "hello"
   2. x = y = "hello"
   
   Yes, in the sense that x = "hello" and y = "hello" in both cases.

- What is the difference between a Range and an Array?
  A range is sequential: a,b,c,d 1,2,3,4 etc
  An array is a collection a,1,b,4,car,baby 

- Why would I use a Hash instead of an Array?
  if you care about the relationship between a key and value a hash should be used.
  if you just want to store a collection of things, an array should be used.  

- What is your favorite thing about Ruby so far?
  It isn't strict on syntax, you dont have to declare everything

- What is your least favorite thing about Ruby so far?
  So many ways to do something, it turns into an artform especially when working in groups. it makes it more important to agree style.

 Programming Problems (10pts each):
 - Write a passing rspec file called even_number_spec.rb that tests a class called EvenNumber.
    - The EvenNumber class should:
       - Only allow even numbers
       - Get the next even number
       - Compare even numbers
       - Generate a range of even numbers
- Make the rspec tests in wish_list_spec.rb pass by writing a WishList class
   - The WishList class should:
      - Mixin Enumerable
      - Define each so it returns wishes as strings with their index as part of the string

Mid-Term Spec (50pts):
- Make the tests pass.
