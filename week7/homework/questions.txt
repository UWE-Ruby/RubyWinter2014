Questions:

2. What is and Eigenclass and what is it used for? Where Do Singleton methods live?

3. When would you use DuckTypeing? How would you use it to improve your code?
    I would use duck typing when there is little or nothing to be gained by using strong typing. It can make code more flexible, allowing you to change the type of a receiver or parameter -- as long as the object responds to the necessary methods, the code still works.

4. What is the difference between a class method and an instance method? What is the difference between instance_eval and class_eval?
    A class method can be called on a class. An instance method must be called from an instance of a class. instance_eval defines class methods and class_eval defines instance methods.

5. What is the difference between a singleton class and a singleton method?
    A singleton method is a method that is defined for a specific object. A singleton class is the anonymous class that is created when a singleton method is defined.
