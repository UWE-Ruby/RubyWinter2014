1. How does Ruby read files?
With File IO objects. Practically, you can mostly do
> while line = gets
but there is also explicit 
> to_be_read = File.new("readme", "r")
or, more idiomatically
> File.open("readme", "r") { |file| <code> }

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
Very casually: 
> File.open("my_output.txt", "a"){|file| file.puts "Hello World!"}
Very very casually, and maybe not so portably (though `sokay across *nix and 
Windows):
> `echo "Hello World!" >>my_output.txt`

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?

4. What is an IO object?
An object representing something outside of your program that you can use as 
a sink or source for data. Files, stdin, stdout, stderr, sockets, FIFOs, and
I'm not sure what else would all be represented as IO objects of some sort. 
Here is a bit where I am still thinking shell is nicer than ruby, because - 
well, see my shell out in question 2.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
A replacement for Makefiles, supposedly with cleaner syntax. I'll get back to
you on this one.
