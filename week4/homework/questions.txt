1. How does Ruby read files?
It uses the base class IO, with the sub class, File.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
Here is one way, using irb:
xabv@V00970630 ~/code/ruby/
$ irb
irb(main):001:0> File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
irb(main):002:1* file.puts "Hello World!"
irb(main):003:1> end
=> nil
irb(main):004:0> exit

xabv@V00970630 ~/code/ruby/
$ ls
my_output.txt

xabv@V00970630 ~/code/ruby/
$ cat my_output.txt
Hello World!

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
Objects of class Dir (directory) are directory streams representing
directories in the underlying filesystem. They provide many methods
to manipulate, delete, list, etc. directories and their contents.

4. What is an IO object?
An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some
external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a gem that provides capabilities similar to make (you can build
programs with it) using settings found in rakefiles.

A rake task is a section of code in a rakefile that performs a job.
It might do a unit test or build a tarball for example. I guess you
could think of it as one piece of an install for a ruby program.
