1. How does Ruby read files?
You can read files using the IO methods provided by the Kernel module
or using IO objects from the IO class, this would be one way to read a
file line by line using IO objects:

File.open("filename") do |file|
    while line = file.gets
        bla bla bla...
    end
end

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
Using IO class, you can open a file for writing (indicated by the "w"
option given below) and send output to the specified file, such as:

File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
    file.puts "Hellow World!"
end

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
Directory class objects are directory streams that represent
directories in a file system. They are used to list directories and
their contents and perform various things like loading a file, etc.

4. What is an IO objecti?
IO objects in ruby belong to the IO class which is subclassed by File
and BasicSocket to provide more specialized behavior. Essentially an
IO object is a two way channel or stream between a Ruby program and
some external resouce.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is a software task management tool written in Ruby. It allows you to specify
tasks and describe dependencies as well as to group tasks in a
namespace. Tasks are the main unit of work in a Rakefile. Tasks have a name
(usually given as a symbol or a string), a list of prerequisites (more
symbols or strings) and a list of actions (given as a block).
