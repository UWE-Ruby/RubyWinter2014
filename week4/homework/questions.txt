1. How does Ruby read files?
Ruby reads files by opening the file with File.open and reading the 
file with File.gets. You do not have to implicitly close the file - 
that is done automatically at the end of the block. 

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
>> File.open("my_output.txt", "w") do |file|
?> file.puts "hello world"
>> end
=> nil
>> quit
m08642391% cat my_output.txt
hello world

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
I'm not sure about this one.   The only thing i found was a Dir class which 
does things like list, change, create, delete directories.  I used the following
code to output my current directory:

> puts Dir.pwd
/Users/xok6/class/RubyWinter2014/week4/homework
=> nil

4. What is an IO object?
IO object is a class which handles input and output.  It's a bidirectional
channel between a Ruby program an external resource.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
rake is a gem for building ruby programs.  Tasks are set up in a Rakefile.
These tasks are the build rules which tells your build what to do and which
files are involved with your build.
