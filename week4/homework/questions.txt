1. How does Ruby read files?
You can open a file using File.open, or another File method.
If you are running from the command line, you can specify the 
files by listing them on the command line like so:

my_program my_file1 my_file2

If you do that, the files will be read through stdin. When one file is finished, the next will be opened.

One nice thing about ruby, is that it can close files for you if you pass a block to open. So 
File.open('./myfile') {|f| buffer = f.read}
would read './myfile' into a buffer and close the file.

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
Open the file with options: 
File.open('my_output.txt', 'w') {|f| f.puts('Hello World')}

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
Dir can open up and manage directories. It is Enumerable, so you can filter files and iterate over them easily.

4. What is an IO object?
It represensts a stream you can read from. It doesn't have to be a file. It can be a socket connection, or and http connection, etc. There are functions in the net library which return these. Since a File is also and IO object, you can operate on them just as you would a file.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
Rake is like make. But it is even better. It is not just for building projects, it is a convienient way to automate various tasks. For example, you can run your tests ,if you set up a test task, using "rake test". Or you could set up a task to compile your sass to css. Or you could set up a task to watch for changes and do both of those when you make changes.
