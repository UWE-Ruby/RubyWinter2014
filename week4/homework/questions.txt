1. How does Ruby read files?
What I gleamed from the book is that basically it reads line by line from the object file, using the File.gets 

2. How would you output "Hello World!" to a file called my_output.txt?
File.open("my_output.txt", "w")
File.puts "Hello world!"
File.close

3. What is the Directory class and what is it used for?
It contains objects that represent directories in a file system, the class is used for modifying, searching for, and listing files/directories. 

4. What is an IO object?
An IO object is a bidirectional channel between a Ruby program and some external
resource. Something you read from and write to.

5. What is rake and what is it used for? What is a rake task?
It's a build tool used to create and manage tasks, sort of like automating things? Nothing I've read has been exactly clear as to what a rake task is, but from what I have gathered it's a task that runs according to the rules and parameters you set in the RakeFile? Need this to be explained.
